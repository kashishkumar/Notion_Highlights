# Thoughts
*There is a treasure, you can find it and it's worth it.** 
*Diversify to reduce risk. Be it in investment, opportunities, income sources, clients, people or virtually anything in life. Just make sure to reduce the correlation between alternatives while diversifying.**  
*Magic happens when you are in a flow state. You are completely involved with a task, time flies, it's joyful experience, similar to meditation but your mind is running fast but still there still a mysterious stillness.** 
*People get this while reading, writing, solving a problem, playing a sport or even dancing. Choose whatever works for you but get into that flow because it's delightful and rewarding.** 
*Some of the things that have helped me generate ideas and think creativitie which can help you as well.** 
*Reading along with highlighting and writing notes** 
*Sharing your failures and vulnerabilties and how you overcame that is really helpful to tell people 'You're not alone'. We have too much of 'my life is great' on social media. It's not easy when you want to show your best side to the world, but if you do that's really helpful to show life is not a bed of roses for everyone else, and you can overcome your challenges.** 
*There are only two things to be considered while making financial decisions. One is liquidity and second is long term growth. You want to maximise long term upside while maintaining liquidity. Liquidity involves hedge for unforseen circumstances and recurring payments. Long term growth involves wisdom, reputation and financial assets.** 
*Write down what kind of experience you want to have when you join a new institution  or a new chapter. Think holistically.**
